If you start up with this mentality, it will bring you nothing but good. So, when you think you have a hint of a product, try to validate it! Get user engagement, create social media account, set up your Mailchimp account and let people see it through a Coming Soon page.

It may sound complicated or you may be inclined to procrastinate, but every step of the way is now made easier. Creative Tim's Coming soon page is a step in that direction. It is easy to set up and customize to your needs. And it will help your customers get the main idea you are trying to create!

The next step is getting the look you want to the page. We added custom filters (standard black, blue, green, orange, red) that give an edge to the page.

IMPORTANT - If you want to integrate a third party service for registering emails we've made a tutorial here:  http://blog.creative-tim.com/web-development/set-mailchimp-custom-coming-soon-page/
